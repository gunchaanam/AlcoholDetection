# AlcoholDetection
This project uses a Fused Capsule Network (F-CapsNet) to detect alcohol consumption from Near-Infrared (NIR) periocular images. It identifies subtle periocular changes caused by alcohol intake, providing a non-invasive and reliable solution for real-time monitoring in healthcare, security, and workplace safety.
